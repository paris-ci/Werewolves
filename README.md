# Werewolves
A werewolves game based on a RESTful API. Uses python3 & hug for the server, and no "exotic" dependencies for the client.

A sample python client is provided, but because of the API server side, you can and are encouraged to make a client in another language or using a different philosophy, as it will still be operating well with others.

## Server-side

You'll find more documentation about the server in the docstrings and in the `server/README.txt`

## Client-side

You'll find more documentation about the client in the docstrings and in the `client/README.txt`

## Official server

I currently host a server, located at `werewolves.api-d.com:8000`
